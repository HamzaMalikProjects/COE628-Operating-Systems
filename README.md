### 📘 Course Overview

COE628 explores the core principles of modern operating systems from an engineering perspective. It focuses on:

- Process management, CPU scheduling, and context switching  
- Inter-process communication and synchronization  
- Starvation and deadlock handling  
- Memory management and virtual memory systems  
- File systems, disk I/O, and resource allocation  
- Hardware-software interface and OS modularity  

The course includes hands-on lab work involving OS module development using C in a UNIX/Linux environment.
